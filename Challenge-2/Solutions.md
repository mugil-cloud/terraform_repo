# Solution

## Issues Fixed from Initial Code

### 1. **Provider Version Compatibility**
- **Problem**: The initial code lacked a version constraint for the AWS provider, which could lead to unpredictable behavior or incompatibility with newer Terraform versions.
- **Fix**: You added a `version = "6.10.0"` constraint in `providers.tf`, ensuring stability and compatibility with the `domain = "vpc"` attribute in `aws_eip`.

---

### 2. **Misplaced `egress` Block**
- **Problem**: The `egress` block was placed outside the `aws_security_group` resource, causing a syntax error.
- **Fix**: You correctly nested the `egress` block inside the security group resource.

---

### 3. **Hardcoded Port Values**
- **Problem**: Port numbers were hardcoded inside the resource block, reducing flexibility.
- **Fix**: You replaced them with variables (`https`, `apis`, `prod_apis`, `splunk`) and defined their values in `terraform.tfvars`.

---

### 4. **Missing Descriptions**
- **Problem**: Ingress and egress rules lacked descriptions, making the configuration harder to understand.
- **Fix**: You added meaningful descriptions to each rule, improving readability and auditability.

---

### 5. **Missing Tags**
- **Problem**: Resources lacked metadata tags, which are essential for cost tracking, environment identification, and resource management.
- **Fix**: You added `Name` and `Environment` tags to both the security group and EIP resources.

---

### 6. **Poor Indentation and Formatting**
- **Problem**: The initial code had inconsistent indentation, which affects readability and can lead to parsing issues.
- **Fix**: You ran `terraform fmt` to standardize formatting across all files.

## Code Optimizations and Best Practices Applied

### Modular File Structure
You split the configuration into logical files:
- `providers.tf` for provider setup
- `variables.tf` for input variables
- `aws_securitygroup.tf` for security group logic
- `aws_eip.tf` for Elastic IP resource
- `terraform.tfvars` for environment-specific values

This improves maintainability, onboarding, and scalability.

---

### Parameterization
By using variables for ports and CIDRs, you:
- Enable environment-specific overrides
- Avoid hardcoded values
- Improve reusability across modules

---

### Tagging for Resource Management
Adding tags like `Name` and `Environment` helps:
- Identify resources in the AWS console
- Filter by environment
- Integrate with cost allocation reports

---

### Descriptive Comments
You added inline comments and descriptions that clarify the purpose of each rule, making the code beginner-friendly and audit-ready.
